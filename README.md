A smart, efficient command-line tool to help you solve the daily Wordle puzzle with optimal guesses. This solver uses a strategy based on information theory to suggest the word that reveals the most information at each step, ensuring you solve the puzzle in the fewest tries possible.

## üé¨ Demo

Here's the solver in action, finding the word `PROXY` in just three guesses:

## ‚ú® Features

- **Interactive Mode**: An easy-to-use command-line interface guides you through each guess.
- **Optimal First Guess**: Starts with `SALET` (or `CRANE`), a word statistically proven to be one of the best starting words.
- **Smart Filtering**: Uses your feedback (üü© Green, üü® Yellow, ‚¨ú Gray) to instantly eliminate thousands of words.
- **Information-Based Strategy**: Each subsequent guess is calculated to provide the maximum possible information, drastically narrowing down the possibilities.
- **Hard Mode Support**: Can operate under "Hard Mode" rules, where all revealed hints must be used in subsequent guesses.
- **Lightweight & Fast**: No external dependencies needed, and it runs instantly.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

You can install the Wordle Solver in one of two ways.

### Method 1: Using Pip (Recommended)

If the package is on PyPI, you can install it easily with `pip`.

```bash
pip install wordle-solver-cli 
# Replace 'wordle-solver-cli' with your actual package name
```
It's recommended to install it in a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install wordle-solver-cli
```

### Method 2: From Source

If you want to run the development version or contribute, you can install it from the source code.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd your-repo

# Install the required packages (if any)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the solver
python main.py # Or however your script is named
```

## üöÄ Usage

The solver works in a simple, interactive loop.

1.  **Start the solver** from your terminal:
    ```bash
    wordle-solver
    ```
2.  The solver will suggest its **best starting word**.
    ```
    ü§ñ My recommended starting word is: SALET
    ```
3.  Enter this word into the Wordle game at [nytimes.com/games/wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle).
4.  **Report the results** back to the solver. Use a 5-letter code where:
    - `g` = Green üü© (correct letter, correct position)
    - `y` = Yellow üü® (correct letter, wrong position)
    - `b` = Black/Gray ‚¨ú (wrong letter)

    For example, if you guessed `SALET` and Wordle returned ‚¨úüü®üü©‚¨úüü®, you would type:
    ```
    > Enter the result (e.g., gybbg): bygyb
    ```
5.  The solver will process the clues and provide the next best guess.
    ```
    üß† Thinking...
    ‚úÖ Got it! There are 42 possible words left.
    ü§ñ My recommended next word is: TRAIN
    ```
6.  Repeat the process until the solver finds the word! The final result should be `ggggg`.
    ```
    > Enter the result (e.g., gybbg): ggggg
    üéâ Excellent! We solved it.
    ```

## üß† How It Works

The magic behind this solver is a combination of word filtering and information theory.

1.  **Word List**: The solver starts with a comprehensive list of all possible 5-letter Wordle answers.
2.  **Best Guess Calculation**:
    - For the first guess, the solver pre-calculates or uses a known optimal word like `SALET`.
    - For all subsequent guesses, it determines the "best" word by calculating the **entropy** of each possible guess. In simple terms, it picks the word that, on average, will slash the list of remaining possibilities by the largest amount, no matter what the color feedback is. This maximizes the information gained from each guess.
3.  **Filtering**: Based on the `gyb` feedback you provide, the solver filters its word list according to these rules:
    - **Green (`g`)**: Keeps only the words that have that exact letter in that exact position.
    - **Yellow (`y`)**: Keeps words that contain that letter, but *not* in that position.
    - **Black/Gray (`b`)**: Removes all words that contain that letter (unless the letter also appeared as a green or yellow in the same guess, which handles duplicate letters correctly).

This process repeats until only one word remains.
